  <h1 class="Bold">CSS Selectors</h1>
        <p>A selector is used to target the specific HTML element(s) to be styled by the declaration.</p>
        <h2 class="Bold">Type Selector | &lt;anytag&gt;</h2>
        <p>Just like its name suggests, the type selector matches the type of the element in the HTML
        document.</p>
        <img id="ParagraphElement" src="./resources/media/01.JPG">
        <p>This is an instance of using the type selector! The element type is p, which comes from the HTML
        &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
    
    <h3 class="Bold"><em>Some important notes on the type selector</em>:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The type selector does not include the angle brackets.</li>
        <li>Since element types are often referred to by their opening tag name, the type selector is
            sometimes referred to as the <em>tag name</em> or <em>selector</em>.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="Bold">Universal Selector | *</h2>
        <p>You learned how the type selector selects all elements of a given type. Well, the universal selector
        selects <em>all elements of any type</em>.</p><br>
        <p>Targeting all of the elements on the page has a few specific use cases, such as resetting default
        browser styling, or selecting all children of a parent element.</p><br>
        <p>The universal selector uses the * character in the same place where you specified the type selector
        in a ruleset, like so:</p><br>
        <img id="UniversalSelector" src="./resources/media/02.JPG"><br>
        <p>In the code above, every text element on the page will have its font changed to Verdana.</p><br>

    <h2 class="Bold">Class Attribute | .</h2>
        <p>CSS is not limited to selecting elements by their type. As you know, HTML elements can also have
        attributes. When working with HTML and CSS a class attribute is one of the most common ways to
        select an element.</p><br>
        <img id="ClassAttribute" src="./resources/media/03.JPG"><br>
        <p>For example, when the class attribute is set to 'brand'. To select this element using CSS, we can create a ruleset with
        a class selector of .brand.</p><br>
        <img id="BrandClass" src="./resources/media/04.JPG"><br>
        <p>To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the class’s
        name.</p><br>
        <p>It’s possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element’s class attribute. For instance,
        perhaps there’s a heading element that needs to be green and bold.</p><br>
        <img id="GreenBoldClassSeperated" src="./resources/media/05.JPG"><br>
        <p>Then, you could include both of these classes on one HTML element like this:</p><br>
        <img id="GreenBoldClassInLine" src="./resources/media/06.JPG"><br>
        <p>We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a space.
        This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a
        custom class for every style combination needed.</p><br>

    <h2 class="Bold">ID Attribute | #</h2>
        <p>If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the id attribute.</p><br>
        <img id="IDAttribute" src="./resources/media/07.JPG"><br>
        <p>In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML
            document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.</p><br>
        <p>To select an element’s ID with CSS, we prepend the id name with a number sign (#)</p><br>
        <img id="IDAttributeExample" src="./resources/media/08.JPG"><br>

    <h2 class="Bold">Attribute Selector | []</h2>
        <p>The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements that already contain attributes.
            Elements of the same type can be targeted differently by their attribute or attribute value.</p><br>
        <img id="href" src="./resources/media/09.JPG"><br>
        <p>The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square brackets. In the above example: [href]
            would target all elements with an href attribute and set the color to magenta.</p><br>
        <p>And it can get more granular from there by adding type and/or attribute values. One way is by using
            type[attribute*=value]. In short, this code selects an element where the attribute contains any
            instance of the specified value.</p><br>
        <img id="AttrValue" src="./resources/media/10.JPG"><br>
        <p>The HTML code above renders two &lt;img&gt; elements, each containing a src attribute with a value
            equaling a link to an image file.</p><br>
        <img id="AttrValueExample" src="./resources/media/11.JPG"><br>
        <p>The attribute selector is used to target each image individually.</p><br>
        <p class="Bold">Notice how no new HTML markup (like a class or id) needed to be added, and we were still able to
            modify the styles of each image independently. This is one advantage to using the attribute
            selector!</p><br>
        
    <h2 class="Bold">Pseudo-Classes | :</h2>
        <p>You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different
            state, after certain user interactions. For instance:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>When you click on an &lt;input&gt; element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in
                    focus.</li>
                <li>When you click on a blue <a> link to visit to another page, but when you return the link’s
                    text is purple.</li>
                <li>When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and disabled. But when
                    all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s active.</li>
                </ul>
        <p>These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action! In fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and
            :active are all pseudo-classes.</p><br>
        <p>Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the document tree can all give
            elements a different state with pseudo-class.</p><br>
        <p>A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon : followed by a name.
            For example p:hover.</p><br>
        <img id="Pseudo-Classes" src="./resources/media/12.JPG"><br>
        <p>In the above code, whenever the mouse hovers over a paragraph element, that paragraph will
            have a lime-colored background.</p><br>
